# Automated Fact Checker
A rather humble attempt to mitigate world ignorance by automating fact checking. Vigilans is a python pet project that uses GPT to check facts on the internet in a very simple manner. 
*It could be used on a larger scale and automate the checking of facts on whole documents. But that is not something I will be working on in the near future*
